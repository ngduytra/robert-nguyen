    description: [
      `I graduated from University of Information Technology. I've been developing decentralized application since 2019. I have the comprehensive knowledge about web development and especially strong at Nodejs(NestJs) and Reactjs. In working, I specially pay attention to code’s performance in all aspects: Database, Back-end, Front-end and the delivering content between Browser and Server. I am always ready to learn new technology as well as improve and sharpen my skills to meet work performance. I am attracted by new technologies especially Blockchain. And I am familiar with writing and deploying smart contracts by using both Rust and Solidity. I am researching as well as developing smart contract on Aptos using Move.`,
      `I am a sport addict and enjoy staying active. I found exercise is important for maintaining physical and mental health, which can be especially important in a fast-paced industry like blockchain development.  Additionally, my love for travel provide opportunities for me to explore new cultures and gain inspiration for my work`,
